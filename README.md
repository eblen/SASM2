# SASM2: SASM reimplemented in Rust

This version of SASM vastly improves on the original in terms of code design. It leans heavily on Rust's advanced enums to implement a simpler and more modular design. This is my first project in Rust, and I routinely spend long hours with the Rust compiler, but I continue to be impressed with how clean and robust the code is once it finally compiles! I have much more confidence that this version will work correctly, even though the original was written in D, which was my favorite language at the time (a vast improvement over C++ IMO).

Run "sasm2 -h" for a list of flags and default values.

See the original SASM project for documentation, code samples, etc. I will add more of such things here soon.
